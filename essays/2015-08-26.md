My name is Marisa Pangan-Hosokawa. I am a junior at the Shidler College of Business. Before attending the University of Hawaii, I graduated from Moanalua High School
There, I became interested in business, especially marketing, international business and MIS.
I decided to add MIS as my major because my advisor said I would not have enough credits to graduate unless I wanted to either add a minor, take random classes, or add another major.
Because of this, I thought that MIS would be a good skill set to have in addition to my other majors.
